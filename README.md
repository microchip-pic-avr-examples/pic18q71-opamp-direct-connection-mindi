# Getting started with MindiÂ® simulation and PIC18-Q71 microcontrollers

This guide will get you up and running with simulating the analog OPAMP module on the PIC18-Q71 family devices using the Mindi simulation tool. **For more information about getting started with and using the MPLAB Mindi Analog Simulator please refer to the following resources:**

## Configuration: Connected Directly to Pins
This configuration connects the bare op-amp directly to the pins, allowing any standard op-amp configuration to be achieved by connecting the appropriate external components.

### Mindi Simulation
![Mindi](images/mplab-mindi-analog-simulator.png)

Download and open the **Mindi schematic [here](schematics/Direct_Connect.wxsch)**.

Press the _play_ button to simulate with an example stimulus source. Note that the un-connected op-amp example is provided without any standard external circuitry.

### Don't have Mindi?
You can download and install the [Mindi simulation tool](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-mindi), or use another SPICE simulator of your own preference. For use with different simulators, a plain spice model can be found in "Opamp_PIC18_Q71.txt" to replace the mindi-optimized ".lb"
